Dragon Park Maintenance Backend
Welcome to the Dragon Park Dashboard! This application provides a user-friendly interface to monitor and manage the status of zones within the Dragon Park. Below are the key features and guidelines for the frontend development:

Dashboard
The dashboard is designed to display the grid of zones in a tabular format. It lists each zone's ID, coordinates, and a simple indicator for its status.

Status Indicators
Use color codes to represent the status of each zone:

Green: Safe
Red: Maintenance
These indicators can be in the form of small colored circles or icons placed next to each zone's entry.

Search and Filters
Implement basic search functionality to allow users to find specific zones by ID or coordinates. Additionally, include simple dropdown filters for status (safe or maintenance) to help users narrow down their view.

Zone Details
Clicking on a zone should open a modal or a separate page that displays essential details, such as the last maintenance date and carnivore presence.

Refresh
Include a manual refresh button that allows users to fetch the latest data from the backend. Real-time updates are not necessary at this stage.

User Authentication
Basic user authentication is implemented to restrict access to authorized personnel. The application will feature a simple login page with a username and password.

API Integration
Ensure that the frontend communicates with the backend API by making HTTP requests to the following endpoints:

GET /zones:

Fetch a list of all zones and their statuses.
GET /zones/:zoneId:

Retrieve details for a specific zone.
# Setup and Installation
Install MongoDB: Download and install MongoDB Community Edition from the official website (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js LTS (Long Term Support) version from the official website (https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs).

Clone the repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

Install dependencies: Open a terminal window, navigate to the cloned repository directory, and run the following command: npm install. This will install all the required dependencies for the Node.js application.

Configure MongoDB connection: In the index.js file, update the mongoose.connect() method with your MongoDB connection details, including the hostname, port number, and database name.

Run the application: Start the Node.js application by running the following command in the terminal: node index.js. The application will listen on port 3000 by default.

API Documentation
Authentication
Login: POST /login

Body:
    - username: The user's username
    - password: The user's password

Response:
    - Success: 200 OK with a JSON message indicating successful login
    - Failure: 401 Unauthorized with a JSON message indicating invalid credentials
    
Zone Status:
    - Get all zones and their statuses: GET /zones
    
    - Response:
          A JSON array of zone objects, each containing the zone's location, safeToEnter status, and needsMaintenance status
        
Get details for a specific zone: GET /zones/:zoneId

Response:
    - A JSON object containing the zone's location, safeToEnter status, needsMaintenance status, and any additional details specific to that zone

# Ensuring Uptime and High Availability
To achieve a 99.99% uptime guarantee, consider implementing the following strategies:

Redundancy: Deploy multiple instances of the Dragon Park Maintenance Backend application across multiple servers or cloud platforms to ensure continuous operation in case of hardware failures or network disruptions.

Monitoring and alerting: Implement monitoring tools to track the health of the application, infrastructure, and database. Set up alerts to notify relevant personnel in case of performance degradation or errors.

Automated recovery: Implement automated recovery mechanisms to restart failed application instances or switch traffic to healthy instances.

Load balancing: Utilize load balancing techniques to distribute incoming traffic across multiple application instances, preventing overload and ensuring optimal performance.

Regular updates and maintenance: Implement a regular update and maintenance schedule to apply security patches, bug fixes, and performance enhancements.

# Scaling for Increased Demand
To handle a large number of dragons (potentially over a million), consider the following scalability measures:

Database optimization: Optimize the MongoDB database for high-volume data storage and retrieval. Utilize indexes, partitioning, and sharding to improve query performance and handle large datasets efficiently.

Caching: Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing database load and improving response times.

Microservices architecture: Consider breaking down the application into smaller, independent microservices to improve maintainability, scalability, and fault isolation.

Distributed systems: Explore distributed systems technologies, such as Kafka or RabbitMQ, to handle asynchronous communication and event-driven architecture, enabling efficient handling of large-scale data processing.

Horizontal scaling: Implement horizontal scaling techniques to add more servers or cloud instances as the number of dragons increases, ensuring adequate resources to maintain performance and reliability.
